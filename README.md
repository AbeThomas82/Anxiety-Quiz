# Anxiety-Quiz

## Description

In this assignment, I was attempting to apply the concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to draw up and implement a quiz website to test the user's rudimentary knowledge of the fundamentals of JavaScript.

The purpose of this assignment was to blend together or weave a combination of various aspects of JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) in order to demonstrate the ability to not only use basic arithmetic to calculate scores but to also use localStorage to save information directly to the local machine. 

Alerts and console logs were included to help the developer follow along in the execution of the assignment.

I have learned from this challenge there are a lot of intricate moving parts in the tabulation and creation of numerical and alphabetic high score arrays in making a quiz. It was interesting to get a look at how many working parts can be used to create a simple quiz.

## Installation

Modified index.html and style.css files in VS Code and included requisite comments.

Added all modified and untracked files in the entire repository using git.

Finally pushed all finished work to GitHub.

GitPages supplied deployed changes to launch refactored website.

## Usage

The end user should be able to navigate through the GitPages site using the answers themselves to proceed in the webpage. At the end, the score is tabulated based on the correct number of answers multiplied by 20 to form a percentage based on the set of 5 questions. Then, the user is able to input their initials, which is used to label their high score. The history of entered scores will be displayed on the page prior to a prompt asking if the user wishes to restart the quiz.
